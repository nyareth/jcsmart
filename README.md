## apple oauth integration

relivator supports sign in with apple using better-auth. to enable apple login:

### setup instructions

1. **create an apple developer account** and set up sign in with apple
2. **create a service id** in the apple developer portal:
   - go to [apple developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)
   - create a new service id (this will be your `clientId`)
   - configure the service id with your domain and redirect urls
3. **generate a client secret**:
   - create a private key associated with your app id
   - use the private key to sign a jwt that acts as your `clientSecret`
   - detailed instructions are in the [better-auth apple docs](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/apple)
4. **configure environment variables** in your `.env` file:
   ```
   APPLE_CLIENT_ID=your.apple.service.id
   APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your.apple.client.secret.jwt
   # optional: for native ios apps
   APPLE_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=com.yourcompany.yourapp
   ```
5. **restart your development server** to load the new configuration

### verification

to verify apple login is working:
1. navigate to `/auth/sign-in` or `/auth/sign-up`
2. click the "apple" button
3. complete the apple sign-in flow
4. verify you're redirected back to your app and logged in

   POLAR_ENVIRONMENT="production" # or "sandbox" for testing
   ```
4. create products in the polar dashboard
5. update the product IDs in `src/lib/auth.ts` to match your polar products:
   ```typescript
   checkout: {
     enabled: true,
     products: [
       {
         productId: "your-product-id", // Replace with actual product ID from Polar Dashboard
         slug: "pro" // Custom slug for easy reference in Checkout URL
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
6. run `bun db:push` to create the necessary database tables
7. start the application with `bun dev`
